# Project: SSIMP
tags: phd, summary statiscs, gwas, .. 

Summary statistics imputation is my main PhD project. 

## summary
Problem: Variants not genotyped > but needed for follow up analysis. 

Solution: Using a combination of known summary statistics and LD estimations in a multivariate normal distribution. 

Challenges: estimating LD matrix

We developed an improved version of SSIMP, that can be downloaded here(). Beyond that, we compared gtimp to ssimp and applied ssimp to height GWAS in order to detect new signals. 

## How does ssimp work

### 1) gtimp vs ssimp graphics (+results)

### 2) method

### 3) novel loci

### 4) variance matching

### 5) missingness (developed by aaron).
