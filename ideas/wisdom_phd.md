# My share on PhD

Now that I have nearly accomplished my PhD, I feel wise enough to share my wisdom on how to master the hurdles that come with it. 

## Mental health

There has been so much written about this, but since its still an issue, I feel there can't be too much be written about it. 

A PhD encapsulates so much uncertainty, paired with high expectations, workload and loads of unwritten rules, that the pressure - unless you are a superstable super self-confident person - will inevitably lead to some broken self confidence. This is probably valid for other positions and jobs too. 

Despite having a helpful supervisor, I got into the depression spiral. Since I was about 16 I have struggled with depression and anxiety. From the beginning I assumed that I was not good enough, and with the ongoing PhD, this was just confirmed. In short, I followed the typical path of an average PhD student with early excitement, followed by a dark hole, treatment of a depression and recovery. Now I feel that not only have I almost finished a PhD in statistical genetics, but also gained a master in my mental health. Here is what I learned. I still have a voice in my head telling me that I am dumb, but its less loud.

- first thing, search for an expert. most universities have a pyschologist. contact them as early as possible. they have lots of experience and you won't be the first student they treat. if you don't like the person that was assigned to you, ask for a change. 

- meditation is for sure a good thing, and now that I have my senses sorted again, I do it often and it helps me to maintain my happiness. But meditation is not always and not only the solution. depression and anxiety root much deeper.

- figure out what you like to do in your spare free time and do more of that. for me, it was to do less sports and more crafting. for others it might be the other way around. problem is: freetime activities can also trigger depression on top of work. 


## How to pick your supervisor:

Pick somebody that you truly like. Best is, if you think back about an annoying collaboration with somebody that either did not talk to you, never responded to an email or always argued with you. You dont want to have such a person as your supervisor. Depending on your personality, you want somebody that you can trust and that has a bit of time for you.
