# My share on doing a PhD aka *what I would have like to be told when starting*

Now that I have nearly accomplished my PhD, I feel wise enough to share my wisdom on how to master the hurdles that come with it. 

Some disclaimer before you read this. I was lucky enough to have a brilliant supervisor that always helped and supported me (one thing is also to **ask** for support - your supervisor won't read your mind). 


## The cave
A PhD is almost designed for holing up in a cave. 

It is only you and your supervisor, and if you are unlucky (I was not), it will be mainly yourself. 

You are always busy. So you slowly cut down meetings with friends. 

Plus you feel clueless all the time, so to avoid the question 'how is the phd going' you slowly cut down meetings with family.

Following the recent progress in science is depressing, so you don't follow that one either and during conferences you hole up too.

If you have a supervisor that prefers to have the stage on his/her own (I was not), then this is even more perfect for holing up. 

At times it can feel that you could disappear and no one would realise it for weeks. 

Which brings me to two other things


## How to pick your supervisor:

Given that you can chose, pick somebody that you truly like. Best is, if you think back about an annoying collaboration with somebody that either did not talk to you, never responded to an email or always argued with you. You do not want to have such a person as your supervisor. Depending on your personality, you want somebody that you can rely on and that has a bit of time for you. 


## Mental health

There has been so much written about this, but since its still an issue, I feel there can't be too much be written about it. 

A PhD encapsulates so much uncertainty, paired with high expectations, workload and loads of unwritten rules, that the pressure - unless you are a super stable and self-confident person - will inevitably lead to some broken self confidence. This is probably valid for other positions and jobs too. But again, I feel like a PhD is designed to leave you alone.

From my experience with depression, anxiety and exhaustion I learned the following:

- first thing, search for an expert. most universities have a pyschologist. contact them as early as possible. they have lots of experience and you won't be the first student they have. if you don't like the person that was assigned to you, ask for a change. 

- meditation is for sure a good thing, and now that I have my senses sorted again, I do it often and it helps me to maintain my happiness. But meditation is not always and not only the solution. depression and anxiety root much deeper.

- figure out what you like to do in your spare free time and do more of that. for me, it was to do less sports and more crafting. for others it might be the other way around. problem is: freetime activities can also trigger depression on top of work. 

- look for a group of people that (what has truly helped me to gain confidence is a group called R-Ladies).

One of the best investments I made during the past few months, was, to get a meditation cushion. Its a daily, visual reminder to sit down and get lost for a while. :meditation:
