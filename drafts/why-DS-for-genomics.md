I decided to write up a few things that I learned about **analysing genomic**^[Genetic? Genomic? AFAIK, in my field (statistical genetics) these two terms are used interchangeably, hence I might drop a *genetics* once in a while, when I mean *genomics* instead. Other fields pay more attention. The definition of *genetics* is the study of genes and their role in inheritance. *Genomics* refers more to the science of the full genome (DNA) and how it all fits together. Therefore, *statistical genetics* might as well be called *statistical genomics*. Here is a good [explanation](https://www.jax.org/personalized-medicine/precision-medicine-and-you/genetics-vs-genomics).] data.

There are plenty of **reasons** to finally tackle this. A selfish one: becoming better at expressing myself and tidying the mess in my head. Another one: enabling others to analyse their own genomic data. The time might never come where companies have access to our most precious information. But when it does we better know how to analyse genomic data ourselves. 

So that is the overarching **goal**: to show :arrow_right: [where to find genomic data](https://sinarueeger.github.io/2018/05/07/post/2018-05-07-data-sources-for-human-genomics.md) :arrow_right: how to make sense from the raw data :arrow_right: how to analyse it and interpret the results. Lots to do - I better get started :smile:!
