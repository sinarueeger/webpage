# How to improve writing - a student's perspective


## Structures of a text

- word: spelling mistake or there could be a better wording
- sentence: how words are ordered (link to zarlab)
- paragraphs: how sentences are ordered (has to do with coherence)
- order of paragraphs (dito)

grammar plays into word and sentences
consistence plays into everything
coherence plays into paragraphs and order of paragraphs.

## Checklist for writer

## Checklist for proofreader
What's wrong with the text

### An example

Hi <name of student>

I improved the document you sent me towards better readability. 

Oftentimes, the structure of your paragraphs is not fluid enough. Try to connect the sentences, so the reader will not get lost midway through your text. 

Best,
<name of supervisor>
