# Biography

I studied Data Analysis & Process Design at the School of Engineering in Winterthur, where I fell in love with applied statistics. I deepened my knowledge in statistical modelling with a master degree and by working as a research assistant. During my time as a biostatistician I enjoyed the interdisciplinary aspect and grew an interest in analysing genetic data - which ultimately lead me to my current position to Lausanne.

Since 2013, I am a PhD student in statistical genetics under the supervision of [Zolt&#225;n Kutalik](https://wp.unil.ch/sgg/) at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland. The focus of my PhD is the analysis of GWAS, -omics and epidemiological data.

Besides data science and biology, I am a keen cyclist. I blog about bike packing [here](https://medium.com/@sinarueeger/).
