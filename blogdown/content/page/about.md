<p align="justify">I am a postdoc in the <a href="https://fellay-lab.epfl.ch/">Fellay Lab</a> at EPFL where I focus on the <b>data analysis of human genomic data</b> in the context of infectious diseases. </p>

## My journey
<p align="justify">I studied Data Analysis & Process Design at the School of Engineering in Winterthur, where I fell in love with applied statistics. I deepened my knowledge in statistical modelling with a Master's degree and by working as a research assistant. During my time as a biostatistician I enjoyed the interdisciplinary aspect and grew an interest in analysing genetic data - which ultimately inspired me to do a PhD in <b>Statistical Genetics</b> under the supervision of <a href="https://wp.unil.ch/sgg/">Zolt&#225;n Kutalik</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland. The focus of my PhD was the analysis of GWAS, -omics and epidemiological data.</p>



## Interests

- Data analysis and statistical modelling paired with R
- Visual representation of concepts and results
- Interplay between health, medicine and technology
- Reproducibility and open science

<p align="justify">I am glad that I encountered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">R</a> early in my studies and I like how it has evolved over time. As an open source project, lots of people are making contributions and so there is always something to learn. I like to share my passion for R, and together with three colleagues I am organising <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-lausanne/">R-Ladies Lausanne</a>.</p>
