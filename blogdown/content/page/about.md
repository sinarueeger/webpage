## My journey
<p align="justify">I studied Data Analysis & Process Design at the School of Engineering in Winterthur, where I fell in love with applied statistics. I deepened my knowledge in statistical modelling with a Master's degree and by working as a research assistant. During my time as a biostatistician I enjoyed the interdisciplinary aspect and grew an interest in analysing genetic data - which ultimately lead me to my current position to Lausanne.</p>

<p align="justify">Since 2013, I am a PhD student in <b>Statistical Genetics</b> under the supervision of <a href="https://wp.unil.ch/sgg/">Zolt&#225;n Kutalik</a> at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland. The focus of my PhD is the analysis of GWAS, -omics and epidemiological data.</p>


## Interests
