<p>Let’s say you get a new project handed over; some kind of data analysis.
What do you feel:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><strong>excitement</strong> of getting your hands onto new data, or</li>
<li><strong>anxiety</strong> that this project may fail, stumbling upon all the data science mistakes that one can possibly make?</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel both of these things. I am always delighted about a. because it means that I still like my work. But b. bothers me to no end, and so I decided to do something about it. Here is my write-up of my coping approach, split into two parts.</p>
<p>This <strong>Part 1</strong> will discuss a mental coping approach, while <strong>Part 2</strong> will show technical solutions that are available in R.</p>
<div id="data-analytic-challenges" class="section level2">
<h2>Data analytic challenges</h2>
<p>There are tons of factors that will influence an analysis - whether controllable or not. Keeping these factors in check is often a challenge.</p>
<p>To give an example: <span style="color:gray"><em>Before actually seeing a dataset and without experience with that kind of data, we have little idea about the effort required to deliver an analysis.</em></span></p>
<p>Of course, with experience, analysts will develop a knack for foreseeing some of these troublesome factors and start to master them.</p>
<p>In the example above, <span style="color:gray"><em>we may ask for a sample dataset first before giving any delivery date; ask for more background information; any analysis previously done; that the dataset be sent in a specific data format, or for the power analysis that was done before the data was generated.</em></span></p>
<p>Such challenges are also highlighted in <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/learning-from-eight-years-of-data-science-mistakes/">this RStudio Conf talk by Caitlin Hudon</a>. Here, Caitlin Hudon talked about different categories of Data Science mistakes, one of them being “Technical / Analysis”, and then goes on to give a list of potential misunderstandings and mistakes. It’s a brilliant talk and I recommend watching it and taking notes of your mistakes (I do that with a simple text file).</p>
<p>Now, a little challenge is different from constant worrying. Constant worrying can come form real problems, say, “data QC will be a challenge”. But it can range up to a cognitive distortion, for example “this project will never end and be a total failure”.</p>
</div>
<div id="does-experience-really-help" class="section level2">
<h2>Does experience really help?</h2>
<p>Making mistakes and developing experience takes time and may also depend on work culture. Most importantly though, your self-confidence, “worry baseline” and core beliefs play a role<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>My point is, that instead of relying on years and years of experience, it may be quicker to apply what I call the “worry battling technique”.</p>
</div>
<div id="worry-battling-technique" class="section level2">
<h2>“Worry battling technique”</h2>
<p>This is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">CBT - cognitive behavioral therapy</a> - an intervention technique used to improve mental health. CBT techniques re-direct emotions and the resulting behaviour.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-03-05-cbt-ds_files/what-can-go-wrong.003.png" /></p>
<p>So that the cycle of Thoughts &gt; Feelings &gt; Behaviour &gt; Thoughts &gt; … becomes less vicious.</p>
<p>CBT also gives coping strategies to change cognitive distortions. You could say that worrying about the outcome of a data analysis after years of data analytic experience is a cognitive distortion.</p>
</div>
<div id="de-catastrophizing" class="section level2">
<h2>De-catastrophizing</h2>
<p>For myself, I have created a mix of several existing techniques around catastrophizing and anxious thoughts (borrowed from worksheets <a href="https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/worry-exploration-questions.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/challenging-anxious-thoughts.pdf">here</a>) that work for me.</p>
<p>Whenever I feel anxiety creeping up, I go through the seven steps. It goes like this:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>

</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Question to ask yourself</th>
<th><em>Example 1: Modelling</em></th>
<th><em>Example 2: Data QC</em></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span style="background-color: #FF0000">1) What is something you are worried about? </span></td>
<td><em>I won’t find the right model for a given dataset. </em></td>
<td><em>I will overlook data cleaning traps (e.g. incorrect identification of missing values) </em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><span style="background-color: #00A08A"> 2) What are some clues that your worry will not come true?</span></td>
<td><em>I have a solid education and it is not possible to find “the best model” anyway - it will always be an approximation and also depends on the time I have at hand. I have modeling validation techniques in place. I dedicate lots of time to talk to subject matter experts and collect background information. </em></td>
<td><em>I have data cleaning techniques in place. I have experienced lots of problems already - I am well prepared. Data cleaning is an iterative process; it’s ok to go back, correct the data cleaning process and rerun it.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span style="background-color: #F2AD00">3) Worst possible outcome</span></td>
<td><em>Nothing fits, or the model does not converge.</em></td>
<td><em>Forth and back, running out of time to do any actual analysis.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><span style="background-color: #F98400"> 4) Best possible outcome </span></td>
<td><em>Perfect model.</em></td>
<td><em>Clean dataset.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span style="background-color: #5BBCD6"> 5) Likely outcome </span></td>
<td><em>I’ll find an ok model after some modelling iteration.</em></td>
<td><em>I’ll overlook a data cleaning aspect, but will fix it and rerun the data QC.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><span style="background-color: #74A089"> 6) If your worry does come true, how will you handle it? Will you eventually be okay? </span></td>
<td><em>I stick to a simpler model and suggest that someone else looks at it with fresh eyes. I will be ok.</em></td>
<td><em>I anticipate my worry and keep data cleaning separate from any analysis. This way I can rerun the data QC at any time again. I will be ok.</em></td>
</tr>

<h2>Core beliefs</h2>
<p>Another exercise is around <a href="https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/core-beliefs.pdf">core beliefs</a>:</p>

<td><em>I am a slow data analyst.</em></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><span style="background-color: #78B7C5">List pieces of evidence contrary to your negative core belief.</span></td>

<div id="why-does-it-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Why does it work?</h2>
<p>I am not a psychologist, so I don’t know.</p>
<p>I guess for me it helps to know that there is a midway between the best and worst scenario, and that even if the worst happens, the world won’t fall apart.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Some people have a tendency to anxiety. Such anxiety may cause unrealistic catastrophizing of a data analysis. This in turn can create an unhealthy nervousness and simply exhaust.</p>
<p>Whenever faced with a “<something> will go totally wrong”, I use a six step questionnaire for myself. Likewise, when I have a negative core belief creeping up, I use a two step questionnaire.</p>
<p>These sets of questions help me and I hope they help you as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>In <a href="">part 2</a> I will discuss more technical solutions, e.g. project set up, QC tooling in R or how important it is to take breaks.</p>
