This is a tutorial how to make a poster from scratch. 

It aims for first-time poster makers, but also for those (like me), that easily get lost in choosing the right font for hours.

## How to make a good poster

An excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58) by Mike Morrison recently made the rounds on the internet. If you have not done so already, watch it before this tutorial. 

Mike Morrison makes the point that most of the posters presented at conferences are not easy to grasp. 

There are two principal reasons for this: 
1. Content is not adapted for a poster presentation.
1. Poor design choices (e.g. small fonts, colors, low-resolution figures). 

Sometimes it seems that a poster contains snippets from a manuscript. 

Separating content from design is important (if you know latex, you know what I mean). 

I will structure my tips into these two parts: [content](#content) and [design](#design), along with a [recipe](#recipe) that I like to follow. 

## Oral versus poster presentation

If you get a oral presentation (congrats!), then you know that your voice will carry most of the talk. While your slides should be [carefully designed](http://damian.conway.org/IBP.pdf), you can still rescue bad slides with a good talk. 

Poster presentations are somewhat special because they are at an intersection of a talk and an art gallery. Meaning, you will have this 2 hour slot once during the conference where you will stand next to your poster. Once in a while, someone will be interested in the topic, and you will guide them trough. This is similar to a lightening talk. 

The remainder of the conference, your poster will just hang there, and maybe some people will still try to understand your topic. No matter how good you are at talking, now it is the design that counts. 

There are some really good examples of entertaining posters. Some read like a comic [link](). I like them in a certain context, mainly when there is no one to guide you through. But unless you are an artist, I would refrain from them. Too much work. 

## Back to the video 

While overall, the video of Mike Morrison is excellent, I struggle with two things. First, it talks about a horizontal poster, and this is often not possible at conferences, due to space constraints^[An straight forward solution is, to turn his design by 90 degrees.]. Second, it talks about emphasising this very clear conclusion. However, in real life, this is often is not possible. For example, because a research project has just started. So instead of having this one research question, I'd go for a main message. That can be _we had a sample size of 100K_ or _we are developing a new method..._. 


## Recipe

Here is a recipe that I always follow. 

### Get ready
1. Choose a **tool** that is easy to operate. I choose keynote. More details [below](#tools).
<img src="material/my-poster/my-poster.001.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

1. **Resize document** to the size recommended by the conference. This way, even though the poster might be proportional to A4, you can use the real size fonts. 

<img src="material/my-poster/my-poster.002.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

1. **Split** the document into different boxes (e.g. four horizontal lines and three vertical lines = 6 boxes). You can do this with _rulers_, _guides_ or with lines. (picture). Each part will later answer a different question.  
<img src="material/my-poster/my-poster.003.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>
1. Get the **logos** you need and store them in a folder next to your presentation `img/logo1.png` etc.  
1. Get the **figures** you want to show and store them in the same folder `img/figure1.png` etc.
<img src="material/my-poster/my-poster.004.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>
1. Now you are ready to add content. 

### Add content
1. **Font** choice: choose one of these popular sans-serif ones {Helvetica, Arial}. They were designed to be easy to read and look good on print. Later on, you can still decide to invest time into checkout out [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif), but remember - it needs to be sans-serif. The smallest text size should be [24 pt](https://guides.library.ucla.edu/c.php?g=223540&p=1480858).
1. Add the title on top.
1. Add authors and affiliation right below.
<img src="material/my-poster/my-poster.005.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>
1. Add contact and lab webpage
<img src="material/my-poster/my-poster.006.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

1. No need to adjust and fiddle around with boxes at this stage. Just fill the [content](#content). 
1. Let's say we have these 6 boxes. 
1. The first box will take care of the [introduction](#introduction) and should answer the question: what motivated your research question?
1. Disclaimer: I work in a field where data and methodology is central, so I always dedicate one box to data and method each.  
1. The second box should present the [methods](#methods): how does the method answer that we want to know?
1. The third box takes care of [data](#data) presentation: what data was used and how is the data characterised? 
1. The fourth and fifth box should contain [results](#results): Data and methods combined, what did we get out? 
1. The six box is dedicated to [discussion](#discussion): What can we conclude from the results? What are our limitations? And where are we heading next?

### Polishing
1. Now that you have all your content, start polishing it. 
1. Replace text with cartoons or figures. 
1. Align all text ... 
1. Add a caption to your figures. 
1. Are your figures (and the rest of your poster) colorblind 
Start adding [colors](#colors)

### Before printing
1. See how it looks like on a printed A4 version.
1. Ask your colleagues what they think of the A4 version and the PDF that you send them. 


## Content

Before adding any content, think about your audience. These will be scientists, and they might have a remote idea of your work, but there will only be a handful of people that know exactly what your domain, topic and method does. They are still interested though. So lets aim for these people as your audience. 

After looking at your poster, the reader should have an idea what the title means. Your poster title might be super clear to you and your lab, but anyone else will have a hard time understanding right away what you are doing. 

Therefore, one goal is, to clarify the words in your title. Title = message. And if title is clear, the message is too. 

After separating your file, you will have 6 boxes. 
1. Introduction to topic
1. Method
1. Data
1. Results general
1. Results specific
1. Discussion (including the Conclusion)

Don't name these sections like this. Instead give them a catchy subtitle.

### Introduction
https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html

- What is the problem?
- Why is it interesting and important?
- Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
- Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
- What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations. 

### Method
- Go from general to specific. 
- If equation, annotate equation
- .. 

### Data
- present the data you used
- How did you process it? 
- 

### Results
- go from general to specific
- Figures: use caption
- Make sure that the results are follow the notation of data and methodology. E.g. if you present results for a trend in age, make sure you have presented age before. 


### Discussion

- future plans
- limitaitons
- conclusion

### Contact
- add your email address
- add lab webpage + the QR code

### References
- add important references (software!)



## Design 


### Colors
- Test in R: https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr
- Test in browser: for example https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/
- Use colors that work better for colorblind people: 
- If you use more colors than available in a discrete color palette - drop that encoding. 
- https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr/blob/master/R/palettes.R
- http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2007/02/post_4.html

```r

library(colorblindr)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
dat <- data.frame(hex = colorblindr::palette_OkabeIto, swatch = colorblindr::palette_OkabeIto)


dat %>%
  mutate(swatch = cell_spec(
    swatch, color = "white", bold = T,
    background = hex
  )) %>%
  kable(escape = F, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = F)
```


### Fonts
- no matter what sophisticated typeface you had in mind, choose one of these popular sans-serif ones {Helvetica, Arial}. 
- Most tools have a `replace font`, so you can replace a font through out your presenation. 
- [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif). 
- whatever works for you
- remember to pay for special fonts 

### Font size
- min 24 pt
- 

### Icons
- free icons here: 
- 

### Tools

- decent zoom
- operate at ease
- you can use over the years
- google presentation, [PowerPoint](https://guides.library.ucla.edu/c.php?g=223540&p=1480858tag), keynote
- inkscape, Adobe Illustrator

### Resolution of figures
If you can, work with PDFs. 
Regardless, your principal figures should _always_ be stored as PDF format. This way, you can easily turn them into a high-resolution PNG or JPEG (big discussions which one is better suited for print). 

To turn a PDF into a high-resolution raster image, use [convert from imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php). 

If your file is called `figure-1.pdf`, then write:

```
convert -quality 100 -background white -alpha background -compress lzw -units pixelsperinch -resize "789x2625" -density 300 figure-1.pdf figure-1b.png
```

If you have lots of pdf starting with `figure-*`, then write:

```
for file in figure-*.pdf; do \
echo $file;\
convert -quality 100 -background white -alpha background -compress lzw -flatten -units pixelsperinch -resize "789x2625" -density 300 $file `echo $file|cut -f1 -d'.'`.png;\
done
```

If you only have raster images and you want to resize them, apply the same command. However, you might end up with poor quality images.
