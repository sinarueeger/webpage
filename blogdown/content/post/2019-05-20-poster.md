This is a tutorial on how to make a scientific poster from scratch. 

It aims for first-time poster makers, but also for people like me that easily loose themselves in choosing the right font for hours. 

It includes a few self-declared best practices that helped me in the past. 


## How to make a good poster

An excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58) by Mike Morrison recently made the rounds online. If you have not done so already, watch it before continuing. 

Mike Morrison makes the point that most of the posters presented at conferences are not easy to grasp. 

There are two principle reasons for this: 

1. The content is not adapted for a poster presentation. For example: reusing whole paragraphs from a manuscript. 
1. Poor design choices. For example: small fonts, problematic color choices, low-resolution figures). 

Separating content from design^["Design" is a big word here. There are people studying design. We might as well call it "polishing".] is important^[If you know latex, you know what I mean.] because it will allow you to focus only on or the other.  


I will structure my tips into these two parts: [content](#content) and [design](#design), along with a [recipe](#recipe) that I like to follow. 

But let's talk first what makes a poster presentation special. 

## Oral versus poster presentation

If you get a oral presentation (congrats!), then you know that your voice will carry most of the talk. While your slides should be [carefully designed](http://damian.conway.org/IBP.pdf), you can still rescue imperfect slides with a good talk. 

Poster presentations are somewhat special because they are at an intersection of a talk and an art exhibition. Meaning, you will once during the conference have the opportunity to guide other researchers through your poster. This is similar to a lightening talk, just more engaging. 

The remainder of the conference, your poster will just hang there, and maybe some people will still try to understand your topic. No matter how good you are at talking, now the poster has to be self explainable.

## Back to the video 

While overall the video of Mike Morrison is excellent, I struggle with three things. 

First, it talks about a horizontal poster, and this is often not possible at conferences, due to space constraints^[However, a straight forward solution is, to turn the design by 90 degrees.]. 

Second, it talks about emphasising this very clear conclusion. In real life, this is often is not possible. For example, because a research project has just started. So instead of having this one research question, I'd go for a main message - what do you want that people remember? That can be the large sample size of your study or that you are developing a new method. 

Third, the poster template still crams the details of the study into a small space.

## Recipe

Here is a recipe that I like follow. 

Also - give yourself at least 7 days from planning to printing. 

### Get ready

1. Take pen and **sketch a draft** on an A4 paper. 

2. Think of a **main message**: what is the one thing that you want that the reader takes from your poster? 

3. Get your abstract and extract **title, author and affiliation**.

4. Create a folder `img` somewhere on your computer. 

5. Copy all the **text, tables and figures** copy them into the `img` folder. 

<img src="/post/2019-05-20-poster/my-poster/my-poster.004.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

6. Get the **logos** of your university and affiliations and store them into the `img` folder too. 

7. Choose a **tool** that is easy to operate and does the things you want. My choice is [keynote](https://www.apple.com/lae/keynote/) because I cannot bother with Illustrator. More details [below](#tools).
<img src="/post/2019-05-20-poster/my-poster/my-poster.001.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

8. **Resize document** to the size recommended by the conference or A0. This way, even though the poster might be proportional to A4, you can use the real size fonts. 

<img src="/post/2019-05-20-poster/my-poster/my-poster.002.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

9. **Split** the document into different boxes (e.g. five horizontal lines and three vertical lines = 8 boxes). You can do this with _rulers_, _guides_ or with lines. Each box will later answer a different question.  
<img src="/post/2019-05-20-poster/my-poster/my-poster.003.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

10. Now you are ready to add content. 

### Add content
1. Before adding content, choose one of the popular sans-serif font: <font face="Helvetica">Helvetica</font> or <font face="Arial">Arial</font>. These fonts were carefully designed to be easy to read and look good on print. Later on, you can still decide to invest time into checkout [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif), but remember - it needs to be sans-serif. The smallest text size should be [24 pt](https://guides.library.ucla.edu/c.php?g=223540&p=1480858).
1. Fill the two top rect angles. 
1. Place the title on top.
1. Add authors and affiliation right below.
<img src="/post/2019-05-20-poster/my-poster/my-poster.005.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>
1. Add contact and lab webpage
<img src="/post/2019-05-20-poster/my-poster/my-poster.006.png" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

1. Next, add your main message below. 

1. No need to adjust and fiddle around with boxes at this stage. Just fill the [content](#content). 

1. Now we are left with 6 boxes. How you distribute the content into these boxes can depend on your topic. I work in a field where data and methodology is central, so I always dedicate one box to data and method each.  
1. The first box will take care of the [introduction](#introduction) and should answer the question _Why is your research needed?_
1. The second box should present the [methods](#methods): what method did you use to answer your research question?
1. The third box takes care of [data](#data) presentation: what kind of data did you use and how does it fit together with the method? 
1. The fourth and fifth box are reserved for [results](#results): What are the results if we combine data and methods? 
1. The six box is dedicated to a [discussion](#discussion) or summary: What can we conclude from the results? What are our limitations? And where are we heading next?

### Polishing & Design

1. Now that you have all your content, you can start polishing it. 
1. Consider replacing text with icons or figures. 
1. Align all text and shapes. 
1. Make sure all titles are equally sized. 
1. Think about whether your figures need captions or not. 
1. Are your figures (and the rest of your poster) colorblind friendly? 
1. You can start adding [colours](#colors), if they serve a purpose. 

### Before printing

1. See how it looks like on a printed A4 version.

1. Ask your colleagues for their opinion: show them the printed A4 version. 

1. You might want to let it sit for a day or two. Just to look at it with fresh and rested eyes. 

1. That's it! Send it to the printing service.

## Content

Before adding any content, think about your audience. These will be scientists, and they have probably heard of your work, but don't know the details and motivation behind your work. Actually, there will only be a handful of people that know exactly what your domain, topic and method does. All others are still interested though. So lets aim for these people as your audience. 

After looking at your poster, the reader should have an idea what the title means. Your poster title might be super clear to you and your lab, but anyone else will have a hard time understanding right away what you are doing. 

Therefore, one goal is, to clarify the words in your title. 

After separating your file, you will have 8 boxes, of which you can use 6 for:

- Introduction
- Method
- Data
- Results general
- Results specific
- Discussion & Summary

You can give these boxes these titles or give them more catchy titles.

### Introduction

I like to follow the [paper writing guidelines](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html) by [Jennifer Widom](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/) as a rough guide:

  - What is the problem?
  - Why is it interesting and important?
  - Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
  - Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions?   How does mine differ?)
  - What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations. 

### Method

- Go from general to specific. 

- If you use equations, make sure to add annotation and explain all the letters. 

### Data

- Present the data you used

- How did you process it? 
- 

### Results

- Go from general to specific
- Figures: use caption
- Make sure that the results are follow the notation of data and methodology. E.g. if you present results for a trend in age, make sure you have presented age before. 


### Discussion

This is the place to

- summarise your work
- conclude
- talk about limitations
- announce future plans

### Contact

- add your email address
- add lab webpage + the QR code to your poster

### References

- add important references, for example software that you used

## Polishing & Design 


### Colors
- Test in R: https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr
- Test in browser: for example https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/
- Use colorblind friendly colors. 
- If you use more colors than available in a discrete color palette - drop that encoding. No one will be able to grasp. 
- https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr/blob/master/R/palettes.R
- http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2007/02/post_4.html

```r

library(colorblindr)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
dat <- data.frame(hex = colorblindr::palette_OkabeIto, swatch = colorblindr::palette_OkabeIto)


dat %>%
  mutate(swatch = cell_spec(
    swatch, color = "white", bold = T,
    background = hex
  )) %>%
  kable(escape = F, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = F)
```


### Fonts

- No matter what sophisticated typeface you had in mind, choose one of these popular sans-serif ones for a start: <font face="Helvetica">Helvetica</font> or <font face="Arial">Arial</font>.
- If you have the time to play with other sans-serif fonts, check out [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif). 
- Making fonts is an actual job - remember to pay for special fonts. 
- Most tools have a `replace font` option, so you can replace a font through out your presenation. 

### Font size
- min 24 pt
- Title should be largest with approx. 150 pt.

### Icons

- You can use free icons from here: 

### Tools

A good tool should satisfy the following criteria:

- decent zoom to zoom in and out
- graphical options
- to be opperable with ease
- something you can use over years

If you have practice with Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape - go for it!

Otherwise, google presentation, [PowerPoint](https://guides.library.ucla.edu/c.php?g=223540&p=1480858tag), keynote - although limiting - might do the job as well. 

### Resolution of figures

If you can, work with PDFs. 

Regardless, your principal figures should _always_ be stored as PDF format. This way, you can easily turn them into a high-resolution PNG or JPEG (big discussions which one is better suited for print). 

To turn a PDF into a high-resolution raster image, use [convert from imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php). 

If your file is called `figure-1.pdf`, then write:

```
convert -quality 100 -background white -alpha background -compress lzw -units pixelsperinch -resize "789x2625" -density 300 figure-1.pdf figure-1b.png
```

If you have lots of pdf starting with `figure-*`, then write:

```
for file in figure-*.pdf; do \
echo $file;\
convert -quality 100 -background white -alpha background -compress lzw -flatten -units pixelsperinch -resize "789x2625" -density 300 $file `echo $file|cut -f1 -d'.'`.png;\
done
```

If you only have raster images and you want to resize them, apply the same command. However, you might end up with poor quality images.
