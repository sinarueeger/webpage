This is a tutorial on how to make a scientific poster from scratch. 

It aims for first-time poster makers, but also for people like me that quickly lose themselves in choosing the right font for hours. 

It includes a few self-declared best practices that helped me in the past. 

I also had stimulating discussions with [Flavia Hodel](https://twitter.com/FlaviaHodel), which helped me a lot to formulate an ideal recipe.


## How to make a good poster

An excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58) by Mike Morrison recently made the rounds online. If you have not done so already, watch it before continuing. 

Mike Morrison makes the point that most of the posters presented at conferences are not easy to grasp. 

There are two principal reasons for this: 

1. The content is not adapted for a poster presentation. For example: reusing whole paragraphs from a manuscript. 
1. Poor design choices. For example small fonts, problematic colour choices, low-resolution figures). 

Separating content from design^["Design" is a big word here. There are people studying design. We might as well call it "polishing".] is important^[If you know latex, you know what I mean.] because it will allow you to focus only on one or the other.  


I will structure my tips into these two parts: [content](#content) and [design](#design), along with a [recipe](#recipe) that I like to follow. 

But let's talk first about what makes a poster presentation special. 

## Oral versus poster presentation

If you get an oral presentation (congrats!), then you know that your voice will carry most of the talk. While your slides should be [carefully designed](http://damian.conway.org/IBP.pdf), you can still rescue imperfect slides with a good talk. 

Poster presentations are somewhat special because they are at an intersection of a talk and an art exhibition. Meaning, you will once during the conference have the opportunity to guide other researchers through your poster. This is similar to a lightning talk, just more engaging. 

The remainder of the conference, your poster will hang there, and maybe some people will still try to understand your topic. No matter how good you are at talking, now the poster has to be self explainable.

## Back to the video 

While overall the video of Mike Morrison is excellent, I struggle with three things. 

First, it talks about a horizontal poster, and this is often not possible at conferences, due to space constraints^[However, a straight forward solution is, to turn the design by 90 degrees.]. 

Second, it talks about emphasising this very clear conclusion. In real life, this is often not possible. For example, because a research project has just started. So instead of having this one research question, I'd go for the main message - what do you want that people remember? That can be the large sample size of your study or that you are developing a new method. 

Third, the poster template still crams the details of the study into a small space.

## Recipe

Here is a recipe that I like to follow. 


### Get ready

1. Start at least 7 days before it needs to go into print^[Make sure you know how much time the printing service needs to print your poster.].

2. Think of the **main message**: what is the one thing that you want that the reader takes from your poster? Write that message into a text file. 

3. Get your abstract and extract **title, author and affiliation** and save it into a text file too. 

4. Create a folder `img` somewhere on your computer. 

5. Copy all **text, tables and figures** you need into the `img` folder. 

6. Get the **logos** of your university and affiliations and store them into the `img` folder too. Trnasparent background, PNG!

1. Take a pen and **sketch a draft** on an A4 paper. 


7. Choose a **tool** that is easy to operate and does the things you want. My choice is [keynote](https://www.apple.com/lae/keynote/) because I cannot bother with Adobe Illustrator. More details [below](#tools).

8. **Resize document** to the size recommended by the conference or A0. This way, even though the poster might be proportional to A4, you can use the real size fonts. 

9. **Split** the document into different boxes (e.g. five horizontal lines and three vertical lines = 8 boxes). You can do this with _rulers_, _guides_ or with lines. Each box will later answer a different question.  

10. Now you are ready to add content.

### Add content
1. Before adding content, choose a sans-serif font. <font face="Helvetica">Helvetica</font> or <font face="Arial">Arial</font> will do a good job. These fonts were carefully designed to be easy to read and look good on print. Later on, you can still decide to invest time into checkout [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif), but remember - it needs to be sans-serif. The smallest text size should be [24 pt](https://guides.library.ucla.edu/c.php?g=223540&p=1480858).
1. Fill the two top rectangles. 
1. Place the title on top.
1. Add authors and affiliation right below (emphasize).
1. Next, add your main message below. 
1. Add contact and lab webpage at the bottom.
1. No need to adjust and fiddle around with boxes at this stage. Just fill the [content](#content). 
1. Now we are left with 6 boxes. How you distribute the content into these boxes depends on your topic. I work in a field where data and methodology is central, so I always dedicate one box to data and one box to methods.  
1. The first box will take care of the [introduction](#introduction) and should answer the question _Why is your research needed?_
1. The second box should present the [methods](#methods): _What method did you use to answer your research question?_
1. The third box takes care of [data](#data) presentation: _What kind of data did you use and how does it fit together with the method?_
1. The fourth and fifth box are reserved for [results](#results): _What are the results if you combine data and methods?_
1. The six box is dedicated to a [discussion](#discussion) or summary: _What can you conclude from the results? What are the limitations? And where are you heading next?_

### Polishing & Design

Now that you have all your content, you can start polishing it. 

In order to quickly grasp a poster, it should have as less text as possible. 

1. Consider replacing some text with icons or figures. 
1. Align all text and shapes (again, rulers might help here).
1. Make sure all titles are equally sized. 
1. Think about whether your figures need captions or not. 
1. Are your figures (and the rest of your poster) colourblind friendly?
1. You can start adding [colours](#colours), if they serve a purpose. 
1. Bullet points

### Finalising

1. See how it looks like on a printed A4 version.
1. Ask your colleagues for their opinion by showing them the printed A4 version. 
1. You might want to let it sit for a day or two. Then look at it with fresh and rested eyes. 

### Trick-trick: Have a detailed and a lean version

After a few days break you look at it again and you realise that it is still to busy with text. 

Here is the trick - keep two versions: the detailed one you already made, and one that has lot less details. 

1. Make a copy of your poster draft, name it `poster_detailed.pdf`. Put this pdf somewhere online and get a link to it (for example dropbox). Generate a [QR-code](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) of that link and download the png to your `img/` folder. 
1. Continue working on your original file. 
1. Count your words. Your aim is now to cut the number of words in half - roughly. If you don't know where to remove content, present your poster to a colleague from the same faculty (not the same lab). You will quickly realise over what details you jump. Remove those details. 
1. If you can simplify the graphs - do that too. 
1. Count the words again - has it been halfed? 
1. Add the QR-code to the bottom of the poster. 

### Printing

1. Print it again in A4 for yourself and check if:
  - all text are shapes are aligned and equally distributed,
  - the font is the same throughout the poster,
  - all authors or affiliations are present,
  - there is a typo,
  - figures are clearly readable (and in high resolution),
  - the QR-code actually leads you to your detailed poster,
  - your contact email address is correct.
  
1. That's it - send it to the printing service!

## Content

Before adding any content, think about your audience. These will be scientists, and they have probably heard about research you are working on, but don't know the details and motivation behind your work. In fact, there will only be a handful of people that know exactly what your domain, topic and method does. All others are still interested though. So lets aim for these people as your audience. 

After looking at your poster, the reader should have an idea what the title means. Your poster title might be super clear to you and your lab colleagues, but anyone else will have a hard time understanding right away what you are doing. 

Therefore, one goal is, to clarify the words in your title. 

After separating your file with rulers as described [above](#recipe), you will have 8 boxes, of which you can use 6 for:

- Introduction
- Method
- Data
- General results 
- Specific results
- Discussion & Summary

I recommend to give your boxes titles so the reader can jump from one to the other. 

What content should go in your boxes? 

I believe that a poster cannot carry a condensed version of a full manuscript. I think it is ok to focus on only one or two threads of your work. Your story telling needs to be coherent - that is all the reader wants. 

### Introduction

I like to follow the [paper writing guidelines](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html) by [Jennifer Widom](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/) as a rough guide:

  - What is the problem?
  - Why is it interesting and important?
  - Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
  - Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions?   How does mine differ?)
  - What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations. 

### Method

- Unless your very focus is a new statistical methods, keep this secion simple and clear.  
- Make sure that it is clear why the method is able to answer your research question. 
- You can use equations, but simplify them too, or annotate them with arrows and explain all fancy letters used. 

### Data

- Mention the origin(s) of your data.
- What was the sample size? 
- No need to describe all the variables you used. To save space, you can also group them into larger categories. 
- Describe distinct features of your data that could influence the interpretation: e.g. if all your samples were male.
- Mention how you processed the data. Again, no need to be specific. If your area uses standard QC methods, mention that the data was processed according to standard QC techniques. 


### Results

- Have two layers of detail. For example, go from general to specific; have a graph that summarises your results, then zoom into your results in a next graph.
- Use figures to illustrate your results and avoid tables. 
- Simplify the figures and use the power of your poster making tool to annotate the figures. 
- Make sure that the results are follow the notation of data and methodology. E.g. if you present results for a trend in age, make sure you have mentioned age before. 


### Discussion

This is the place to:
- summarise your work
- conclude
- talk about limitations
- announce future plans

### Contact

- add your email address
- add lab webpage + the QR code to your (detailed) poster

### References

- add important references, for example software that you used
- make sure you cite original content

## Design 

### Tooling

A good tool should satisfy the following criteria:

- Decent in zooming in and out.
- Variety of graphical options.
- Operable with ease.
- Something you can use over years. 

If you have practice with Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape - go for it!

Otherwise, google presentation, [PowerPoint](https://guides.library.ucla.edu/c.php?g=223540&p=1480858tag), keynote - although limiting - might do the job as well. 

### Fonts

- No matter what sophisticated typeface you had in mind, choose one of these sans-serif ones for a start: <font face="Helvetica">Helvetica</font> or <font face="Arial">Arial</font>.
- If you have the time to play with other sans-serif fonts, check out [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif). 
- Making fonts is an actual job - remember to pay for special fonts. 
- Most tools have a `replace font` option, so you can replace a font through out your presenation. 

### Font size
- Minimum 24 pt, but use it sparingly. 
- Title should be largest with approx. 150 pt.

### Icons

Some icon services are for free, or at least partially: e.g. [flat icon](https://www.flaticon.com/).


### Figures

Principles for data visualisations could easily occupy another blog post. There is much to say, but let's keep it short here. 

If you use R and ggplot2 for making your figures, use one of the black and white themes, e.g. `theme_set(theme_linedraw())`. 

Make sure that the axis text size is also 24pt once it is on the poster. 

### Resolution of figures

Your principal figures should _always_ be stored as PDF format. This way, you can easily turn them into a high-resolution PNG. 

To turn a PDF into a high-resolution raster image, use [convert from imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php). 

If your file is called `figure-1.pdf`, then write:

```
convert -quality 100 -background white -alpha background -compress lzw -units pixelsperinch -resize "789x2625" -density 300 figure-1.pdf figure-1b.png
```

If you have lots of pdf starting with `figure-*`, then write:

```
for file in figure-*.pdf; do \
echo $file;\
convert -quality 100 -background white -alpha background -compress lzw -flatten -units pixelsperinch -resize "789x2625" -density 300 $file `echo $file|cut -f1 -d'.'`.png;\
done
```

### Colours

Colors are either used as decoration or to encode a variable. 

**Always** use [colourblind friendly colours](http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2007/02/post_4.html). 

You can test the colourblind friendlyness of your poster and figures in a browser: https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/.

For Figures:
- If you use more colours than available in a discrete colour palette - drop that encoding. No one will be able to grasp. 
- Use colorblind friendly palettes from the [colorblindr](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr/blob/master/R/palettes.R
) R-package.

<!---------
```r

library(colorblindr)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
dat <- data.frame(hex = colorblindr::palette_OkabeIto, swatch = colorblindr::palette_OkabeIto)


dat %>%
  mutate(swatch = cell_spec(
    swatch, color = "white", bold = T,
    background = hex
  )) %>%
  kable(escape = F, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = F)
```
