I work - broadly speaking - in epidemiology. Within collaborations we often have to share **sensitive data** accross institutions, therefore not sharing IT facilities. But the most often used options - bare e-mail or file hosting - are not secure options, as they both work via a server. 

There are a handful of secure options around ([ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) or [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/)) (working via [encryption](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-encryption-important)), but for those that trust open source projects the most I have written some basic instructions for asymmetric GPG encryption. 

I should say that I am not an encryption expert at all. But, although there is a lot of talk about data protection, I never came across a compact, easy-to-follow instruction for the sender of the document and the recipient, valid for all three operating systems (Linux, Mac, Windows). Therefore I tried to write one, mainly for myself (to memorise the steps) and collaborators. The following instructions are written for people that are familiar with a terminal.

- Here are the instructions for the [sender of the document](https://gist.github.com/sinarueeger/aadfe4916cf285e32d5a55f320a82a6f#file-encryption_files-md).
- Here are the instructions that the [recipient](https://gist.github.com/sinarueeger/aadfe4916cf285e32d5a55f320a82a6f#file-encryption_files_recipient-md) needs to follow.

Feedback is highly appreciated!
