I work - broadly speaking - in epidemiology. Within collaborations we often have to share (sensitive) data accross institutions (therefore not sharing IT facilities). But bare e-mail or file hosting are not secure options. 

There are a handful of other options around ([ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) or [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/)), but for those that only trust open source projects I have written some basic instructions for asymmetric GPG encryption. 

I should say that I am not an encryption expert at all, but I never came across a compact instruction for the sender of the document and the recipient for all three operating systems (Linux, Mac, Windows). The instructions are written for people that are familiar with a terminal. In a way I mainly wrote this for myself and potential collaborators.

- Here are the instructions for the [sender of the document](https://gist.github.com/sinarueeger/aadfe4916cf285e32d5a55f320a82a6f#file-encryption_files-md).
- Here are the instructions that the [recipient](https://gist.github.com/sinarueeger/aadfe4916cf285e32d5a55f320a82a6f#file-encryption_files_recipient-md) needs to follow.

Feedback is highly appreciated!
