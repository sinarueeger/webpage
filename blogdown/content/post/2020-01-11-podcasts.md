I listen to podcasts like other people watch TV or read books. I still read books and watch TV, but listening to a podcast keeps me focussed like nothing else. Usually, I do some unsophisticated knitting next to it. Nothing beats that combination - so calming and perfect for reflection. 

## R & stats & data science
Here is a list of my go-to podcasts that touch on R, statistics or data science: 
- [**Not So Standard Deviations**](http://nssdeviations.com/): Entertaining chit chat - uplifting and enlightening. 

- [**Credibly Curious**](https://soundcloud.com/crediblycurious) is about R: 
They manage to get these technical bits into a podcast, which is amazing! 

- [**The Corresponding Author**](https://twitter.com/CorrespondAuth): About academic data science. The podcast I'd wish I'd had during my PhD. 

My absolute favorite is **Not So Standard Deviations** by Hilary Parker and Roger Peng. Both born to talk. They can turn something seemingly banal into an exciting topic. Every time you think "*now* they will run out of topics" they come up with some amazing new thought. Mostly, their hour-long by-weekly episodes feel like you are listening in to a conversation between them. Their coffee discussions are in a way pointless but make 100% sense to me. Through their podcast, I got to know one of my other favorite podcasts ([Sticky Notes](http://stickynotespodcast.libsyn.com/)). The best thing - they giggle so much that if you feel a little down, you will be cheered up in no time! 

There are a bunch of other podcasts I have not started listening to but should: 
- [Casual inference](http://casualinfer.libsyn.com/) by Ellie Murray and Lucy D'Agostino McGowan
- [R podcast](https://r-podcast.org/)  by Eric Nantz
- [Tidy Tuesday Podcast](https://www.tidytuesday.com) by Jon Harmon

See also [this list](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/podcasts/technical-podcasts.html) for a comprehensive overview. There are tons of analytics podcasts out there. Best is to listen in and see if you like them. 

## Science podcasts

Most of us data scientists or statisticians have some domain we work in. Mines are health and academia. So here are the podcasts that touch on that: 

- [Mosaic Science Podcast](https://mosaicscience.com/) from the Wellcome Trust (basically articles about their research read by someone). 
- [Everything Hertz](https://everythinghertz.com/) by Dan Quintana and James Heathers (I particularly like their interviews, loved [this one](https://everythinghertz.com/91) with Kristin Sainani). 

I used to listen to [Science Disrupt](https://sciencedisrupt.com/) too. 

## Work-related podcast

[**The Broad Experience**](http://www.thebroadexperience.com/) by Ashley Milne-Tyte. Aiming at working women, but many topics apply to anyone. My favorite: Episodes [128](http://www.thebroadexperience.com/listen/2018/6/13/episode-128-youre-worth-it-the-power-of-negotiation-part-1) and [129](http://www.thebroadexperience.com/listen/2018/6/20/episode-129-youre-worth-it-the-power-of-negotiation-part-2) on Negotiation. 

## Podcast wishlist

I am still waiting that someone starts a podcast about **statistical genetics** or **genetic epidemiology**. Nothing hard-core, just diving into methods. 

Thanks to the podcasters for the entertainment and MaÃ«lle Salmon for the inspiration.
