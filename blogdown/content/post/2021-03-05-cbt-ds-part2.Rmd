<span style="background-color: #F2AD00">_This blogpost is about solutions to tackle constant "data analysis worrying"._</span>
  
[**Part 1**](https://sinarueeger.github.io/post/cbt-data-analysis-part1/) discussed a mental coping approach, while **Part 2** will show more technical solutions and prevention techniques. Let's dive right in!  


## 1. Work organisation

Write code such that mistakes can be corrected and analysis rerun easily. 

The reasoning: _this allows you to be at ease and not afraid of mistakes. Mistakes will happen to the greatest data analysts, but if you have a code/computing environment set up where you can quickly make a change to a code snippet written 2 months ago, and rerun the analysis, then you won't fear mistakes. It's one thing less to worry about. _

- Use version control for code (and backup resulting data regularly and in a systematic way).
- Use an R-package to help with the analysis project organisation: [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets), [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/getting_started.html), [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/) and probably lots more.

- Apply [best practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) (contains valueable tips, among them data management, project organisation, software).

## 2. Breaks

Take breaks often, especially when debugging - a draining activity - or during deep work. This will help to keep the focus up - even though it seems like you are taking the focus away by leaving your desk briefly. 

The important bit is, that you rest during the break. Pet your cat, drink a coffee, watch the cars pass. 

The comic below by [Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/comics/take-breaks/) shows the value of taking breaks in the context of debugging, but seems legit during a normal work day too.

### Breathing

During the break, or when stressed, apply [box breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6RbW2LtdFs). When stressed, our breathing becomes shallow. I don't know the science behind it, but any type of deep and regular breathing helps to calm down and refocus.

### Pomodoro Technique

When to take breaks? The official [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is: work 25 min, have a 5 min break. 

There are tons of apps around for exactly this purpose, but I found my **oven timer** most effective (I _really_ have to leave my desk to turn off the timer).

## 3. R packages for high confidence in data

### Use modern tooling

When reading in and out tables, don't rely on `read.table`. Instead, use a more modern tooling, such as `data.table::fread` or `readr::read_table` that have not only faster, but are better in recognizing column data types. 

### Automatic data sanity checking

Use R-package `janitor` to apply automatic data checks. 

Use R-package `skimr` to summarize your data quickly.

## 4. Familiarize yourself with methods

When applying a statistical method, the most important bit will be the valdiation part - is your model behaving the way it should. That can be the residual plot for logistic regression, ... for random Forest, ... for .

By exposing yourself to the methods you use, you will ..

## 5. Debugging

If you happen to run into bug follow these tips by [Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/comics/attitude-matters/). Above all - take a [break](#breaks)!

### Quick changes vs. systematical approach

Quick bug fixes do exist, but if it takes more than a few minutes, you may better be off to take a break and approach the bug more systematically later on.

I find walks in forests the best to think about bugs. 

### The power of debugging

Finally, debugging is not all bad. On the contrary, debugging might be an opportunity to refactor some code, rethink a method, learn something new (see [love your bugs by Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/comics/love-your-bugs/)) or simply becoming better at staying composed during debugging.
