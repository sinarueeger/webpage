This is the course material to the workshop _Robust data analysis: an introduction to R_ held at the [_Open Science in Practice_](http://osip2019.epfl.ch/) Summer School 2019 at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland, and taught with the help of [Allie Burns](https://twitter.com/imallieburns).  

Here are [the slides](https://sinarueeger.github.io/robust-data-analysis-with-r/slides-robust-da.html#1) and [the workshop handbook](https://sinarueeger.github.io/robust-data-analysis-with-r/).

I drew inspiration for the workshop from the following material:

- [_Let them have cake first_](https://twitter.com/minebocek/status/1072222447473168389?lang=en) by [Mine CetinkayaRundel](https://twitter.com/minebocek).
- [_Ten quick tips for teaching programming_](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006023) by [Neil Brown](https://twitter.com/neilccbrown) + [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson). 
- The [beautiful illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/master/openscapes/starwars-rey-rstats.png) by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst).
