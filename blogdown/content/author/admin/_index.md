I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Fellay Lab at EPFL, where I analyse human genomic data in the context of infectious diseases.

My interests include statistical modelling, statistical genetics, programming with R, reproducible analysis workflows, and topics intersecting health, medicine and technology.

I received my PhD in Life Sciences in 2018 from the University of Lausanne, where I worked on the imputation of GWAS summary statistics supervised by Zoltán Kutalik.

What I enjoy the most about applied statistics is the interdisciplinary aspect of collaborations that allows me to glimpse into different domains. 

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring nature on a bike and contributing to open-source projects.
