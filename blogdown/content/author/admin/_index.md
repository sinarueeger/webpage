As a member of the [FinnGen](https://www.finngen.fi/en/Workinggroups) analysis team, I analyse large-scale genomic and phenotypic data.

My interests include statistical modelling, statistical genetics, programming using R, reproducible analysis workflows, and topics touching on health, medicine and technology.

During my PhD in Life Sciences at University of Lausanne, I worked on the imputation of GWAS summary statistics supervised by [Zoltán Kutalik](https://wp.unil.ch/sgg/). 
<!------- This was followed by a Postdoc in the [Fellay Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/fellay-lab/) at EPFL, where I analysed human genomic data in the context of infectious diseases. -------->

For me the most enjoyable aspects of applied statistics are interdisciplinary collaborations that allow a glimpse into different domains. 

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring nature by bike and contributing to open-source projects.
